*Below is a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsanalytics/comments/hfipjn/any_ideas_for_paperssoftwarepeople_etc_that/) I made on a [r/sportsanalytics](https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsanalytics/) that didn't get much traction (Probably because the stupid OG image). I'm be happy to accept any contributions to the list*

I'm a college student studying C.S that does work in trajectory prediction for pedestrians, card etc.
I thought trajectory prediction in the sports domain sounded like a fun project and was surprised to find that there was already a lot of sophisticated research done. There were papers submitted to large conferences such as CVPR, NIPS and AAAI.

That had me wondering what other sports analytics work has been done, so I decided to put together an Awesome List for machine learning applications in the sports.

The list is far from complete and I would really appreciate help curating things to include!

I'm looking for anything from

People / Books / Papers / Software / Datasets / Tutorials and Talks / Resources for students / Blogs /Links !

I there's anything you think should be included please let me know!
