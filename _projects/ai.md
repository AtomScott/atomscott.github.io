*What is the future going to look like?* To answer that question we need to know the past and the present, then extrapolate.

Each time I survey the a specific field in artificial intelligence, I will like a go down a rabbit whole. For example, pedestrian trajectory prediction. It's only a niche subject at first glance. There are hundreds of papers dating back to decades ago. There is so much to digest and the more I look in to it, the more perspective I loose on the bigger picture.

At least once a month, I wanted to take a step back and take a holistic stance. What are the trends? Where are the biggest breakthroughs being made? Who are the key players? Where is the money? Where is the hype? ...and where is the real deal?

From a research perspective, interest in artificial intelligence is at an all-time high. More and more papers are being published each year.

However, a search in google trends shows that the interest in the word "artificial intelligence" is actually rather steady.

All I know is that there is a large disconnect, somewhere, somehow.

My interest will be in reasearch, so I will do [light analysis of trends.](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/612768/we-analyzed-16625-papers-to-figure-out-where-ai-is-headed-next/) But I will also look into business trends.
