This is project (that is now discontinued), where I tried making YouTube videos and web design using Vue.js.
The overall experience was fun, but very costly in time. I eventually decided to stop after realizing that I would need to rewrite the majority of the code in the Nuxt.js framework in order to get SEO to work properly. I'm no web developer and I don't intend to become one anytime soon, so thats that. 

I might work on this project a bit more if I can find the time to, in the future.
