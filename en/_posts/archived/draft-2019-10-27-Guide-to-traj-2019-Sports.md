title: Predicting The Future In Sports With Deep Learning
comments: true
description: >
  Being able to predict trajectories of people is useful for obvious applications such as human interactive robotics and autonomous vehichles. There is also an interest in team sport since it could provide insight for tactical analsis. In this post, I will write about Multi-Agent Trajcetory prediciton (e.g. tracking in team sport). In the post before I wrote about Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction.

# Predicting The Future In Sports With Deep Learning

- toc
{:toc} 

## Overview

There is an [awesome github page](https://github.com/jiachenli94/Awesome-Interaction-aware-Trajectory-Prediction#sport-players-1) for pedestrian trajectory prediction with a section specifically for papers in sport.

Below are summaries of each post describing the main ideas and methods used.
