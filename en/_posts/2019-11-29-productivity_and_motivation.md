# Productivity and Motivation

At least once a week, I crash and motivation leaves me like a soul leaves a dead body. Sometimes I crash for a few hours. Other times I crash for days. This time was the worst, I don't think my productivity and motivation have been up for nearly 5 days.

How to break the downwards spiral? How to keep throughput consistently high? Why I am I not performing? What's wrong with me?

At this point, Google has become my personal therapist. But it hasn't helped me much. On the contrary, the fucker has been feeding off my weakness, giving me access to Youtube, Twitter, Reddit etc.

They're after my attention and I've given it to them. For Free. Fuck.

## Crashes

Crashes aren't a result of fatigue, at least for me. I think they're the result of too much "rest". Too much rest lets the primal part of my brain take over. 

I usually get too much rest by oversleeping. This is how it happens. 

The nightbefore: I've had a really productive day and I'm happy for myself. I think I can actually do more so I do more. Or I reward myself with some Youtube to wind me down. 

Either way, Bam before I know it, it's gone past 3. WTF?

I force myself to stop whatever I'm doing and get to sleep.

I wake up. 6:55, thats my superpower. I can get up 5 mins before the alarm goes off. I get up and I'm tired. Of course I'm sleep deprived. I need more sleep to be sharp enough to be productive. 5 minutes more isn't going to cut it. So I go to sleep again.

I wake up and it's 12 o'clock. I should have woken up three hours ago. I should be in the lab doing research. Fuck. 

Self-hatred kicks in and a part of me wants to get back to work, but another wants to just go back to sleep. I won't go back to sleep again, but I'll be on pretty low energy for the rest of the day. I won't be focused and I definitely won't be able to do any qualily research.

Sometimes this would go on for consecutively. Especially if I'm not hold accountable for the terrible work done during this time. 

(Writing all this makes me feel like a piece of shit, but at the same time it's quite cathartic).

## Sticking to a schedule

I know that crashes are caused by late nights and late nights are caused by my own decision to stay up late. So all I havce to do to avoid crashes is to stick to a schedule. I can do that right?

Turns out sticking to a schedule is fucking difficult. I mean it really fucking is. 

The week before, I was able to wake at 7 twice. This week, not a single day was I able to sleep at 12 and wake at 7. It's more like 4 to 12, yeah I've slept longer but I still feel like shit. Still tired and, worst of all, not making any progress. 

How does everyone do it? 

I'm not sure, but I think the first thing to acknowledge is that most people don't do it. It's hard to be act like a machine when you're human. Most people aren't motivatied 24/7. Look even Sam Altman has days where he probably crashes.

I think I just have to plow through it with will power. Sometimes I just have to say fuck it and get stick to the schedule even if I do produce shit work, eventually the fog will rise.

## Optimism

Be optimistic and aim too high. <s>I need a fucking reason to get out of bed. That reason is never going to be $1500 monthly paycheck. Wait..  the fuck? I don't have a reason at the moment... </s>

I don't need a fucking reason to get out of bed, I'm gifted with the time to **really work on self-improvement**. Not many people get that chance. But circumstance has its ways and here I am. Another 3 years of schooling.

I going to stick with that mindset for a long time. Fuck everything else.

Okay, I'm over with my rant. I'm going to get back to work.
