# 【Update】 December Coding update

[November Update](https://atomscott.github.io/blog/en/2019-11-08-November-Coding-Update/)

It's been nearly a month since I've started to learn competitive programming, but I haven't been able to progress as much as I thought I would.

## Reflection

Below are a few goals in mentioned in the previous post:

- Aim for profiency in C++.
- Get the basics done (e.g stuff like hackerrank)
- Compete!

Firstly, I stopped trying to learn C++ early on. It turns out that I could just use python must of the time, and in times when python is too slow, I could just use PYPY.

A good example of the benefits of PYPY is the code I used in yesterdays [competition](https://atcoder.jp/contests/sumitrust2019/tasks/sumitb2019_d). 

I got a TLE from the python3 compiler while the same code compiled PyPY just worked like magic.

So I couldn't find a reason to learn C++ just yet. PyPY seems to serve me well enough for now.

Secondly, I thought that I should spend more time learning and implementing algorithms instead of doing random C++ questions on hackerrank. So I'm quiting CodeMonk/HackerRank. Instead, I'll focus only learning from [these](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/pythonds/index.html) [books](https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B00CY9256C/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) and implementing solutions in python.

Lastly, I did try to compete in every atcoder competition that was rank. THB, I really sucked at most of them and my most recent competition was pretty bad as well.

I'm just going to have to keep on trying.

Here's what my current graph looks like. (Spoilers, I'm still shit!)

## Goal until next month

Two Goals. Read through the two books I mention above!
