This is a log of my first kaggle competition. Let's see how everthing goes.

### 9/29 Google Research Football Kaggle Competition!

Today, at around 3AM local time (Japan), I got an DM from a lab mate about a new kaggle competition. Although having made a kaggle account several years ago, I've always been a lurker and never entered a competition before.

However, since this research is related to [my current research](https://atomscott.github.io/blog/en/2020-09-21-About-me/), I thought I could persuade my PI at AIST to let me spend two months on this competition.

### 10/1 ~ 10/8 Week 1. Convincing my PI

So, today I brought up the kaggle competition to my PI. I couldn't convince him on the spot, but I was given the chance to prepare some materials for another time.

### 10/9 ~ 10/23 Week 2&3. Studying Reinforcement Learning

I've started looking into Deep Reinforcement Learning and how to apply it Google Research Football. I've got a rather large exam on 10/20, so I can not devote all my time to Kaggle until after that.

Here are a list of the papers, material that I went through in this period.
