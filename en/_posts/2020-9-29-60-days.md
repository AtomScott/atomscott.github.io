This is a log of my first kaggle competition. Let's see how everthing goes.

### 9/29 Google Research Football Kaggle Competition!

Today, at around 3AM local time (Japan), I got an DM from a lab mate about a new kaggle competition. Although having made a kaggle account several years ago, I've always been a lurker and never entered a competition before.

However, since this research is related to [my current research](https://atomscott.github.io/blog/en/2020-09-21-About-me/), I thought I could persuade my PI at AIST to let me spend two months on this competition.

### 9/30 Convincing my PI

So, today I brought up the kaggle competition to my PI. I couldn't convince him on the spot, but I was given the chance to prepare some materials for another time.
