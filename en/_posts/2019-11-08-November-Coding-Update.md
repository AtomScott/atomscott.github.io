description: >
  Being able to predict trajectories of people is useful for obvious applications such as human interactive robotics and autonomous vehichles. There is also an interest in team sport since it could provide insight for tactical analsis. In this post, I write about the basics of Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction. In the next post I will write about Multi-Agent Trajcetory prediciton (e.g. tracking in team sport).

# [Start] November Coding Update Thread

I've decided to learn more on algorithms and data structures!

To be honest, I don't feel like my degree in computer science has given me the skills that I would like in the area and Ii seems like there is much more than what I currently understand now. 

(I'm not condemming uni. Going to university was great! Courses yeah meh but I was focusing and extracurricular stuff and DL/RL)

Also, I mad a huge mistake by forgetting to sign up to a class in the spring and I have to earn those specific cre dits in order to graduate. So I'm set back a year for missing just one class (= 2 credits). 

Looking on the bright side, that means I have made myself some time to learn something new. And that thing that I'm going to learn is algorithms and data structures. 

## The Goal

**The Goal is to become a blue coder on [AtCoder](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&tl=en&u=http%3A%2F%2Fchokudai.hatenablog.com%2Fentry%2F2018%2F12%2F04%2F193246) by the end of 2020.** 

The motivation for this goal is four-fold:

- I like competition!
- I'm based in Japan at the moment and plan to be for at least another 3 years (AtCoder is primarly Japanese).
- It's a SMART goal (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Timely). Most importantly, I can measure my progress overtime and experiment with learning.
- Theres a coding section for masters entrance interview in August.

I think the bar is raised fairly high and with the fact that I can't fully commit due to DL research in mind, I have my doubts. If I finish early, or think that the bar is to high and I've learnt enough, I will move on to work on becoming a kaggle master! (Lol, I hope no one is actually reading this).

## The Plan

Based on the research I've done, I think I should just go ahead and code/enter lots of competitions! However, I do want some structure so I will follow this format, but probably not in strict order:

1. **Aim for profiency in C++.** It's been at least 2 years since I've touched C and 5 years for C#. I use Python for nearly everything, but Python doesn't seem great for competitive programming. 
    - [HackerRank C++](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/cpp?filters%5Bstatus%5D%5B%5D=unsolved&badge_type=cpp) 
  
2. **Get the basics done.** To tell you the truth, I have taken a DS&A course in my 1st year of uni and read chunks of Cormens textbook. So, most of this will be review and C++ practice.  
    - [HackerRank Problem Solving](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/data-structures)
    - [HackerEarth Code Monk](https://www.hackerearth.com/ja/practice/codemonk/)

3. **Compete!** There's some sort of constest in AtCoder about everyweek. 

## Experiments

- **Anki.** Memorization can inhibit deeper thought and the ability to apply knowledge, so I've been skeptical of tools that promote it. Why try to understand a mathematical when you can remeber it? :rofl:	At the same time, spaced repetition does have its appeals. I think I'll use it mainly for abstractions and to remember the bigger picture of DS&A. 

That's it for now, lets see how much I get done by decemeber and extrapolate from there.
