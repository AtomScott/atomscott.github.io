# What would a nice work day look like?

Continuing from the [last rant](../2019-11-29-productivity_and_motivation/), I haven't really made much of an improvement. There are still days where I'm not productive at all and I still beat myself up about it.

Even though I literally have more time on my hands than before, I feel like I don't. I think this is due to a lack of scheduling and reflection. Last month I decided to micromanage myself, but I haven't been able to. We could this be?

The reason is the lack of forced deadlines, or trailing unfinished work. When I have a bad day or for some reason can't finish work in time, I'm faced with a choice:

A. Should I try to work more even though I'm tired and am starting to procrastinate?

B. Or should I call it a day and move on to the next thing to do?

Unfortunately I always pick A. and consequently start to procrastinate. I've started to recognize this pattern now, so I think I need to schedule accordingly.

From one perspective, calling it a day on something that *needs work*, i.e. not always doing the thing with the highest priority on my list seems really inefficient. But from experience, that just doesn't work in practice. 

Also, it's extremely short-sighted and negligent of human limits. It also introduces more randomness in the scheduling system, especially when people are prone to tiredness and procrastination. 

## So again, I'm going to practice self-micromanagement. But this time..

I'm going to stick to a daily routine like template, which isn't too strict on time. Plus, I'll try to schedule a rest day at least once a week (I can't remember the last time I did that).

A template for my daily work.. hmm... what would that look like? I guess a should start off thinking what a nice day would look, a day where I can get in bed, close my eyes and just feel, I gotta say, today was a good day.

**Points to consider**

- Time splits e.g. max work time
  - Def cant do more than 5 hours at one block
- Food and prep â†’ budget
  - Cheaper, quicker the better, but also nutrition!
- what to work on?
  - Daily self improvement +visible
- best work hours
  - From 30mins after the coffee after lunch -> 14:00~15:00
- Clothes, dishes etc. Chores
  - Hmmm... I hate these

## The Template

**Wake** 6:30~7:00
To go to the gym!
Also, any later than 10:00, it messes with eating schedule.

**Breakfast** ~7:00
Theres a 2 hour time gap here to do something productive.

**GYM** 9:00~10:30
I dont' want to go to the gym right after eating or waking up, so I want 2 hours inbetween.

10:30~ work

**Lunch** 12:00 ~13:00

**Core work** 13:00~18:00

**Dinner** 18:00~19:00

**Sub work** 19:00~22:00

**Sleep** 23:00
Fuck thats early.
