Hi, I've moved my website to github pages so I don't have to worry about hosting services!

With the fees spared from hosting, instead of saving it up like a sensible person, I bought a new cool website theme called Hydejack. This lets me write a blog as well so I am very pleased with it.

A research blog or something similar would be very nice to write.
